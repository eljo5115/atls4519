We can create a list with an index for each time during the day the pool could be open. We can iterate through the list of times to instantiate the cow objects into the appropriate index in the availableTimes list while also adding each cow object to a seperate list. The second list, here it's longCows, is used when iterating through the availableTimes list to find the maximum amount of time while ignoring each cow in the longCows list, essentially simulating firing each cow individually before deciding how much time will be covered.</p>"
